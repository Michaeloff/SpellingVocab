# Spelling Vocab Site - WordQuiz.org

This repo represents an early static version of the spelling/vocab site https://wordquiz.org with HTML/CS/JavaScript files.

The current site uses a WordPress image, with the spelling functionality injected as a PHP/JS plugin. The server-side PHP controls the db access to the mySQL database. Word and user-specific data are read and updated. An admin-only interface is available to edit word and expand word data.

The site is in active use by local Roseville schools and beyond as part of a larger educational mission found at: https://bigbrainjunction.org
